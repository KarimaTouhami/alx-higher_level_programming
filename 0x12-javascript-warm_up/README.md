0x12. JavaScript - Warm up
## Background Context
JavaScript is used for many things. Here, you will use JavaScript for 2 reasons:

<p>Scripting (same as we did with Python)
Web front-end
For the moment, and for learning all basic concepts of this language, we will do some scripting.</p>
<p>After, we will make our AirBnB project dynamic by using Javascript and JQuery.</p>
